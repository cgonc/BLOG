I am just a professional software developer. I have never written any scientific paper. The motivation behind this blog is that I need to arrange my
notes about programming languages which I had taken from Coursera in a digital environment. Most of the topics noted here are widely understood and documented so there is no new theory or something similar.
I mostly depend what I see from code and its output and course notes. If you think I did a serious mistake and grasp the theory in a wrong way for a certain topic please email me.
