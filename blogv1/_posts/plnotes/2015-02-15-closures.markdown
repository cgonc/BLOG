# Closures #

<p align="justify">
A closure is a closed language construct which has two parts, the code for the function
and the environment that was current when we created the function. It is like an ML pair,
just something with two parts however you can not access the parts of the pair separately.
All you can do is call the function. Lets define a closure in Java.
</p>
{% gist cgonul/3f3aa72db76e253d3df6 %} 

And the output :
{% highlight  java%}
//*--THE OUTPUT--*//
x : 2
x : 3

{% endhighlight %}

As it is mentioned all you can do is call the closure. You can not access it is environment but the
function in it has the capability of changing this special environment. In Java you need an interface 
to define a closure. In javascript it seems more natural.
{% gist cgonul/acb017aaecbcf8fd55f4 %} 

And the console output :
{% highlight  javascript%}
//THE OUTPUT
x : 2
x : 3

{% endhighlight %}

In later posts I will mention about memoization, callbacks, thunks and streams which are all implementations of closures.
