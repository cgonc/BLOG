This post includes some simple functions which is written in Scala language.
All of the simple routines are written as tail recursive functions.
</p>

 * __pow__ calculates the power of x over y
 * __sum_list__ calculates the summation of an integer list
 * __append__ is an interesting function introduced at the Dan Grossman's course. It is simple but I have 
   never thought that way.
 * __count_down__ generates an integer list from x down to 1 inclusive.
 * __count_up__ generates an integer list from 1 up to x exclusive.
 * __max__ is used to find the maximum of an integer list.
 * __factorial__ calculates the factorial of n.
