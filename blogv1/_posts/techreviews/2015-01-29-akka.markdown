Although it seems the simplest concept in programming languages, there are lots of concepts to be thought of when researching variables and bindings. 
There should be a large amount of abstraction when examining variables and bindings because if someone digs deep and goes to lower levels of abstraction, 
he/she will encounter memory address abstraction which vary widely among the underlying computer architecture and among the programming language on top of it.
